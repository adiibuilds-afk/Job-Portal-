# Vercel Web Analytics Integration

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` (v1.6.1) to project dependencies using npm
- Updated package-lock.json to reflect the new dependency and its sub-dependencies

### 2. Modified Files

**app/layout.tsx**
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the Providers component and BatchPopup
- Placement ensures analytics tracking is active across the entire application

### 3. Implementation Details
- This is an App Router project (uses `app` directory structure)
- The Analytics component was added to the root layout file (app/layout.tsx)
- The component is positioned after all other content in the body tag, which is the recommended practice
- No existing code structure was modified; only additive changes were made

### 4. Verification Completed
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ No new linting errors introduced in layout.tsx
- ✅ Dependencies installed and lock files updated correctly

## Files Modified
1. `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
2. `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
3. `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree

## Usage
Once deployed to Vercel, the analytics will automatically start tracking page views and web vitals. No additional configuration is needed, though custom events can be tracked using the Analytics API if desired in the future.

## Notes
- The project uses npm as its package manager (evidenced by package-lock.json)
- Pre-existing linting issues in other files (unrelated to this change) remain unchanged
- The build output confirms the application compiles correctly with the new changes
